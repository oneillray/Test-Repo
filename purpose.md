I created this repo just so I can learn git and move off using Tower. Maybe soon I'll have for a good use for this repo like, a blog post or even a web project. Either way it might be of some interest to someone in the future who finds terminal as scary as I do. 

#### If I'm to succeed as a developer than I'm going to have level up with GIT and terminal. I've being dragging my heels for too long. Come at me git.
